## <u>Prime Numbers</u>:
A prime number is a positive integer greater than 1 that has no 
positive integer divisors other than `1` and `itself`. In other words, 
a prime number is only divisible by `1` and `itself`. Examples of prime 
numbers include `2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 
61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97`, and so on. 
The study of prime numbers and their properties is an important topic in number 
theory and has many applications in computer science and cryptography.
